# coordinates
A simple python command line tool. It helps to manage your Minecraft coordinates and create tp commands, which are immediately copied to the clipboard.

## What I learned:
- .json usage to store and fetch data
- Interacting with the computer's clipboard

## To Execute:
- Execute through the main.py file
- Use load, user, or no keyword depending on desired operation
